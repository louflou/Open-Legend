            <h1>Why Open Legend<small> RPG </small></h1>
            <p>If you have played roleplaying games in the past, you may be wondering What makes Open Legend worth my time? What makes it different?</p><p>The secret’s in the title: Open. Everything about the game has been built to open up the doors of possibility so that every table tells a legend worth telling. Here are a few of the possibilities that Open Legend offers.</p><p>Open Source. That’s right. The core rules are free to use with accommodation for commercial and non-commercial derivative works. We know the public will love the game as much as we do, and we hope they’ll spread the love by publishing their own adventures, rules supplements, and more.</p><p>Open Dice. In Open Legend, dice explode! That means that whenever ANY die rolls maximum, you get to reroll it and add the new roll to your total, ad infinitum. The volatile nature of dice rolling makes every roll count, and each session of Open Legend is full of tense moments when the tides can turn at a moment’s notice, for better or worse.</p><p>Open Legend. You get to tell the story that you want to tell, with the characters you want to play. You aren’t tied down to specific class, archetype, or race combinations. The only limit is your imagination (and maybe the GM’s veto power). Rather than a list of set classes with a menu of skills to pick from, you start the game with attribute points that you spend as you wish to give your character the powers they need.</p>

            <h2>Welcome to Open Legend <small> a tabletop roleplaying game (or RPG) in which the players take the part of mighty heroes and wicked villains in order to tell stories of epic proportion.</small></h2> <p>As in the vignettes above, every game of Open Legend revolves around intrepid characters performing heroic deeds. They will fight mythic beasts, outsmart cunning foes, break ancient curses, crack baffling cases, discover untold treasures, and more.</p><p>If you have never played a roleplaying game before, you can think of it as a movie in which the actors make up the script (and even much of the plot) as the movie is being shot. One player, called the Game Master (or GM), acts as producer, director, and writer. The GM establishes the setting, creates the antagonists, and develops enough plot to get the other players started. The GM also acts out the part of the villains and neutral characters in the story.</p>The rest of the players take the role of Player Characters (or PCs). The PCs are the protagonists of the story. In a high fantasy setting, one PC might be a dwarven warrior with a lust for gems, another an immortal elven wizard whose only desire is knowledge, and still another a half-angelic priest who travels the world in order to inspire others to act justly. In another game of Open Legend, the players might star as a rag tag crew of space pirates living from score to score on their barely functioning merchant class starship. All the common tropes could make an appearance: the reckless pilot, the brash captain with a troubled past, the hired gun, the stowaway, and the engineer who gets along with the ship better than with the crew.</p><p>Whatever the motivation of their characters, the players share a common goal: to take the plot and setting established by the GM and have fun. At some tables, this might look like J.R.R Tolkien’s Lord of the Rings. In others, it might look more like Monty Python and the Holy Grail. Whatever fun looks like at your table, Open Legend will be a part of it.</p><p>This is your story. Tell it.</p>
