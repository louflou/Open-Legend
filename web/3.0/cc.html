                                        <p>Sometimes a new player will join a campaign in progress in which the other PCs have already advanced
                                        several levels, so it would be unbalanced to insert a first level character into the party. Other times,
                                         the GM may decide to run a campaign with PCs who have already accumulated some wealth and power.</p>
                                        <p>Your level is used to determine your maximum attribute score as well as to provide a general indication of
                                           your power compared to other characters and enemy or ally NPCs.</p>

                                      <h5>XP</h5>
                                      <p>As the legend you are creating unfolds and grows in danger and magnitude, your character’s power will grow to
                                        match the challenge. This power comes in the form of <b>experience points</b> (or XP), which are rewarded by the GM and
                                        allow you to advance in level and gain access to new feats, attributes, banes, and boons. Your total XP earned determines
                                         your level, with every 3 XP allowing you to advance to the next level.</p>

                                        Open Legend uses a simplified wealth system.</p>
                                        <p>Every character has a wealth score, which begins at 2 and can range from 0 to 9, fluctuating up and down as you acquire
                                        and spend your riches. Your wealth score provides a general description of how well-off you are and the typical types of
                                        goods and services you can acquire.</p>

                                      <p>Speed indicates how far your character can move using a single move action. Your base speed is 30 feet (just over 9 meters). Other effects, such as banes, boons, and feats may cause your speed to increase or decrease.</p>

To make your character come to life, add some details. If you can’t think of anything yet, try to fill in the blanks during your first couple of play sessions as you get to know your character better.</p>

                                    <p>Perks are characteristics that describe very specific skills, attitudes, backgrounds, or opportunities that tend to give your character the upper hand in certain situations. </p><p>For example, maybe you are a noble and thus able to draw favors from powerful political figures, or perhaps you once served as mechanic on a starship and those technical skills still help you out in your adventuring life today.</p>

                                    <p>Flaws are your Achilles' heel. They are weaknesses that your enemies can exploit or character deficits that always seem to hold you back at just the wrong moment. Maybe you are stubborn as a mule and won't accept a compromise under any circumstances. Perhaps your greed tends to get the best of you, and your love of coin will even trump your loyalty to your friends. Your flaws might even be physical in nature: you're blind, missing an arm, or suffer from a wounded knee that slows you down.</p>

A soldier is well-versed in a variety of arms, understands military tactics, and knows how to navigate the chain of command with ease. Furthermore, whenever you are performing a task in which your professional skills would play a role, you gain advantage 1 to any non-combat action rolls that you must make.</td>

                                    <h5>AQUIRING PERKS & FLAWS</h5>
                                    <p>At character creation, you may select up to two perks and two flaws, and you do not have to select any. Throughout your adventures, the GM may assign you additional perks and flaws as the natural results of your deeds. For example, if your party spends several months on board a ship, the GM may reward everyone with the profession: sailor perk. Likewise, if you are subjected to horrible chemical burns as part of a laboratory explosion, the GM might assign you the physical deformity flaw to describe your scarred face.</p><p>You too, may decide to adopt new perks or flaws with the GM's approval as your character’s personality and background develop through play. Perhaps a series of encounters with powerful forces leads you to take on the cowardly flaw. Or maybe you spend significant downtime between adventures training with the local weaponsmith and would like to gain the artisan perk. The GM is the final arbiter for deciding when and under what circumstances you may choose new perks and flaws.</p>

                                    <h5>DESIGNING YOUR OWN PERKS & FLAWS</h5>
                                    <p>The lists provided in this chapter are by no means comprehensive, and you are encouraged to work with your GM to create the perks and flaws that you need to define your character.</p><p>Flaws are very easy to create, as they simply represent situational triggers that hold your character back. Because the PCs decides when their flaws take effect, there is no need to consider balance when creating new flaws.</p><p>Perks, on the other hand, often grant elaborate benefits and even mechanical bonuses. These require you to work closely with your GM to ensure that your perks are balanced with the other perks available to PCs. The first rule to adhere to is that perks should provide non-combat effects, as feats, banes, and boons are the primary means for PCs to boost their combat expertise. Next, try to make your proposed perk limited to a specific type of task or a relatively rare situation. For example, the artisan perk provides expertise for a single craft, and the attractive perk is only beneficial in social situations that rely on physical attractiveness. If your perk is more generally applicable, then the effect should be more limited than other perks. For example, the idol perk makes you trusted by just about anyone, but it is limited to being used once per game session.</p>

                                <h5>ACQUIRING EXTRAORDINARY ITEMS</h5>
                                <p>Extraordinary items can be acquired in a number of ways. They may be taken from the horde of a fallen enemy, gifted from a patron as a reward for a job well done, purchased from an obscure wandering merchant, or even crafted by a PC using the Craft Extraordinary Item feat.</p>
                                <p>However, extraordinary items are so powerful that they have the potential to dramatically alter the course of the story and the wielder’s capabilities. As such, they always require the approval of the GM to acquire. The GM can use an item’s wealth level as an indication of the relative strength of an extraordinary item, but the decision to allow a character to acquire such an item should depend on factors such as how much it adds to the story and how it affects the balance of power among all of the PCs.</p>
                                <h5>EXTRAORDINARY ITEM DESCRIPTIONS</h5>
                                <p>Extraordinary items are different from weapons, armor, and other gear because they give the wielder access to attributes, banes, and boons that are beyond their current power–or they bolster the attributes, banes, and boons that the wielder can already access. The Extraordinary Items Table outlines a variety of such items spanning many genres. The examples include weapons and gear of powerful magic, alchemy, and technology–and they should provide plenty of inspiration for coming up with your own extraordinary items for your campaign.</p>
                                <h5>WL (WEALTH LEVEL)</h5>
                                <p>Indicates the wealth level associated with this extraordinary item. Acquiring the item requires a sufficient wealth level and follows all of the rules for wealth established in the table regarding <a href="#clps-weapons" data-parent="#accordion5" data-toggle="collapse"> Weapons & Equipment.</a></p>
                                <h5>ATTRIBUTES</h5>
                                <p>Indicate which attributes, if any, the item can make use of. An item can use an attribute to make attacks, invoke banes and boons, and perform other actions that would reasonably fall within the item’s capabilities. The wielder spends their own actions to use an item’s attributes, but all attribute dice and power levels are determined by the item’s attribute score, not the wielder’s. The wielder’s applicable feats still apply. If the wielder’s attribute is greater than the item’s by one or two points, they may use their own attribute, and the item instead grants advantage 1 on rolls with that attribute. This bonus can only be applied once to a given attribute, regardless of how many items you wield that possess the attribute.</p>

                                <h5>BANES & BOONS</h5>
                                <p>indicate the banes and boons that the item grants access to. The wielder can use the item to invoke the listed bane or boon. The numeric value is used to determine both the power level and the attribute dice used for the invocation roll. The wielder may choose to invoke at a lower power level than that listed, in which case the attribute dice rolled are not reduced. All of the same rules for items with attributes apply, except in this case the granted access is for the listed banes or boons only.</p>
                                <p>Properties are the descriptors that make each extraordinary item unique from others. These properties translate to specific game mechanics listed below.</p>

                                <p>Whether you are trying to buy new equipment, construct a building, or hire a craftsman, your wealth score determines if you are able. Every good or service is assigned a wealth level (either in the rules or by the GM). This level is compared with your wealth score in order to determine the cost of acquiring the item, as follows:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>If the good you want to purchase has a level lower than your wealth score, you can acquire the item easily without taxing your time and resources.</li>
                                    <li>If the item’s level is equal to your wealth score, you can acquire it, but the expense taxes your resources such that you cannot acquire new goods at that level or higher for two weeks.</li>
                                    <li>If the object of your purchase is one level higher than your wealth score and your wealth score is above 0, you can acquire it, but the cost is so great that your wealth score is reduced by 1.</li>
                                    <li>You cannot make purchases that are more than one level higher than your wealth score.</li>

                                    <p>Below, each bane description includes the following elements.</p>
                                    <p>Power Level. This number indicates the required attribute score needed to inflict the bane. If multiple power levels are listed (such as 2 / 4 / 6), then the bane can be inflicted at multiple tiers of power. The Persistent Damage bane, for example, deals increased damage as you inflict it at higher power levels.</p>
                                    <p>Attack Attributes. This is a list of the attribute or attributes that can be used to inflict the bane. As long as you possess at least one of the listed attributes at a score greater than or equal to the Power Level, then you can inflict the bane.</p>
                                    <p>Attack. This list indicates what type of attack roll to make when inflicting the bane. Each entry consists of an attribute that the attacking player should roll and the defense score targeted by the attack. If the attacker’s roll equals or exceeds the target’s defense score, then the bane is inflicted.</p>
                                    <p>Duration. A bane typically remains in effect until the target resists it using a resist action, hence most banes have a duration of “resist ends”. If a target fails three resist rolls against a bane, the bane can no longer be resisted. It persists for an extended duration indicated in parentheses.</p>
                                    <p>Description. This entry simply provides a general idea of what the bane could look like in the story.</p>
                                    <p>Effect. This entry indicates the mechanical effects of the bane on the rules of the game.</p>
