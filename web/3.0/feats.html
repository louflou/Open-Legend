<p>Feats are used to define your character’s specializations–the actions, tasks, and abilities they excel at beyond all others. Some feats will enhance your major actions, such as by allowing you to multi-attack with reduced disadvantage, while others will grant you completely new powers, such as the ability to change your shape.</p>
<br><h5>Reading a feat Description</h5>
<p><b>Cost: </b> This is the number of feat points required to take this feat. Characters get 6 feat points at 1st level, and 3 feat points each time they level up. If the feat has multiple tiers, the cost is the same for each tier and must be paid every time the feat is purchased at a new tier unless otherwise noted in the feat description. So, to access the Tier 5 ability of a feat, you must pay for the feat 5 times. If a feat does not have a noted exception it can only be purchased once.
<br><b>Prerequisites: </b> Feats can have prerequisites that you must meet when you select it. They can either require a minimum attribute score or they can sometimes require other feats.
<br><b>Description: </b> This entry simply provides a general idea of what the feat could look like in the story.
<br><b>Effect: </b> This entry indicates the mechanical effects of the feat on the rules of the game.

<td>Alternate Form I</td>
<td><b>Prerequisites: </b> None.
<br><b>Description:</b> You have the ability to transform from one persona to another, whether that be through bodily transformation like a werewolf or through exterior mechanisms, such as a cybernetically enhanced soldier who can call forth a symbiotic mech suit.
<br><b> Tier: </b>Upon taking this feat, you build a single alternate form using the normal character creation rules, though your attribute and feat points are determined by your tier in this feat: Half of your primary form's attribute points (rounded up), and 3 feat points.
<br><b> Effect: </b>Whenever your primary form gains new attribute points or levels up, your alternate form also gains points according to the above formulas.
As a focus action, you may change between any two forms (including your primary form or any alternate form). You maintain this capability in all of your forms.
Each form is treated as a completely different character for mechanical purposes - possessing different attributes, feats, perks, flaws, and other defining characteristics. Your alternate form does, however, retain the ability to transform back into your primary form.
In order to keep track of hit points, you should always record the total damage that your character has suffered. When transforming, your damage remains with you even if your maximum hit points change. Additionally, when changing forms, if your hit points would be reduced to less than 1, your hit point total becomes 1 instead.
<br><b> Special: </b>When selecting feats for your alternate form, you may not select the Alternate Form feat.
With GM approval, you may take this feat multiple times. If you do, you get access to an additional form. Multiple Alternate Forms can be a powerful way of accumulating new feat points and attributes. The GM should prevent players from exploiting the feat to create an overly powerful character.</td>

<br><b> Tier: </b>Upon taking this feat, you build a single alternate form using the normal character creation rules, though your attribute and feat points are determined by your tier in this feat: Same attribute points as your primary form, and 3 feat points less than your primary form.

<td>Area Manipulation I</td>
<td><b>Description: </b>Whether unloading your assault rifle on full-automatic or hurling a ball of flame, you are exceptionally precise at choosing targets for area attacks, allowing you to avoid allies who would otherwise be caught in the line of fire.

<th>Armor Mastery I</th>
<td><b>Description: </b>Whether you are a heavily armored mechanized knight or a nimble rogue in studded leather, you and your armor are one. Your training and experience at wearing armor allows you to maximize its protection and minimize its drawbacks.
<br><b> Tier: </b>he Fortitude prerequisite for wearing armor is reduced by 1. When wearing armor, you get a +1 armor bonus to your Guard defense.
<br><b> Effect: </b>Your training allows you to sleep in armor without gaining one level of the fatigued bane. In addition, while wearing armor, you gain the following benefits:</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Ear of the Emperor</th>
<td>You have done something in the past to earn the favor of someone in a high place: a senator, the general of an army, a merchant lord, etc. Perhaps you saved their life or spared them from significant monetary loss. Whatever you did, they owe you, and they are willing to help you with minor favors as long as the favors do not subject them to any risk or cost. Once during the campaign, you can call in a large favor that does put your contact in risk or cost them something significant. They will perform the favor, but you immediately lose this trait, as their debt has been repaid.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Extraordinary Presence</th>
<td>Your inherent extraordinary nature manifests itself in a tangible way of your choosing. For example, your eyes may glow, your skin might emanate an icy chill, or a trail of withering plants could follow you wherever you set foot. Depending on the nature of your extraordinary presence, it might make others more likely to fear, admire, or trust you–or otherwise alter their initial perceptions of you. Whenever your extraordinary presence is relevant in a social situation, you gain advantage 1 on any action rolls you make.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Fugitive</th>
<td>You are part of a illegal network, whether it be a thieves’ guild, an underground network of stolen data brokers, or otherwise. Once per game session, you can call in a favor from a contact within your network to perform a mundane task such as gathering information or arranging safe passage. If the favor puts your contact at risk, they will still perform it but may ask for an equally risky favor from you in return.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Idol</th>
<td>Your reputation for some outstanding virtue precedes you, and people tend to hold you in high esteem. Once per session, you can call upon your reputation to inspire trust from someone who is skeptical of you, your actions, or your allies.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Innocent</th>
<td>Whether from a distant fey ancestry or simply an air of naivety, you possess a childlike quality that can melt even the coldest of hearts. Once per game session, you can leverage your innocence to turn an enemy and cause them to take pity on you. The enemy might choose to look the other way when you’ve done something illegal, forgive a debt you could never pay, or vouch in your favor before the authorities.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Jack of All Trades</th>
<td>You have a knack for picking up new skills. Once per game session, provided you are not under pressure from an inordinately tight deadline, you can automatically succeed at a non-attack action roll that relates to some craft, trade, skill, or similar work provided its Challenge Rating is less than or equal to 14.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Legendary Bloodline</th>
<td>Your ancestry can be traced to dragons, Void Templars, an ancient order of Archmagi, an intergalactic dynasty, or a similar powerful group. As such, a sense of awe follows you when met by those who know and respect your heritage. Choose an area of expertise, such as arcana, politics, or warfare. You are assumed to have knowledge and a destiny for greatness in the chosen area of expertise, and others treat you with deference. This influence could guarantee your placement within an Arcane College, grant you access to the Void Templars securely encrypted database, secure a mentorship under a famous Senator, or cause a Lieutenant who does not know you well to take combat orders from you based on your training in an elite task force.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Local Hero</th>
<td>You are well-known and respected as a protector of the common folk in a small region. The average citizen in this area will look up to you, and will offer you food, shelter, and other necessities. They will even take risks or assume minor costs to aid or protect you, so long as the risk is not death.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Lucky</th>
<td>Once per game session, in a moment of need, you can call on luck to shine upon you. The GM decides what form this luck takes. For example, an attack that was meant for you might target an ally instead, you may discover a secret passage to escape from a rolling boulder, or a local law enforcement officer decides to overlook your crime because you happen to have grown up on the same street.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Merchant</th>
<td>You understand the art of economics as well as the best of businessmen. A master of supply and demand, you have a knack for knowing when to buy and when to sell. You cannot be swindled when it comes to bartering, and you always know whether or not you are getting a fair price. Furthermore, you have friends in merchant circles and guilds in your home city, and you can easily gain such connections in new locations given enough time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Nature's Ally</th>
<td>The natural world responds to your deep connection with it. Perhaps you are a preservationist, seeking to restore organic life in a shattered post-apocalyptic wasteland, or maybe you are a hermit closely attuned to the animals and plants of the Sylvan woodlands. Whatever your circumstance, people and creatures connected to the land can sense your deep respect for the natural order. Wild animals are more receptive to your desires, primitive tribes give you the benefit of the doubt by assuming you do not have destructive intentions, and you can typically gain an audience with an elusive Druid or Shaman in a give region who shares your goal in defending nature.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Observant</th>
<td>Your keen senses allow you to notice details that others typically miss. Once per game session, you can use this ability to notice something out of the ordinary. For example, you might spot a hidden passage behind a bookcase, a trace of blood under the fingernails of another character, or a wig that is not quite convincing. If you use this ability after failing a Perception roll, the GM decides whether you notice the initial target of your roll or a different detail.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Profession</th>
<td>Choose a specific trade, such as sailor, soldier, or miner. You know everything there is to know about the business and are a master of the requisite skills. A sailor, for example, can tie a knot for all occasions, navigate by the stars, and man any station aboard a ship. A soldier is well-versed in a variety of arms, understands military tactics, and knows how to navigate the chain of command with ease. Furthermore, whenever you are performing a task in which your professional skills would play a role, you gain advantage 1 to any non-combat action rolls that you must make.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Pure-hearted</th>
<td>Any goodly-natured creature you encounter is friendly toward you by default rather than neutral. Circumstances can alter this, but even if rumors or actions you’ve taken would influence a good creature negatively, it remains one step friendlier than it otherwise would have been.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Resilient</th>
<td>You are exceptionally difficult to kill or wear down. Once per game session, you can automatically succeed a Fortitude action roll of Challenge Rating less than or equal to 10 + twice your Fortitude score.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Scavenger</th>
<td>You have lived a life of need, and thus know how to make do when others would go without. Once per game session, you can easily acquire a single mundane item even though it would otherwise take time to get or be completely unattainable. Depending on the circumstances, the GM may decide that your acquisition is only temporary or subject to reasonable conditions. For example, you might use this perk to acquire a rope in the middle of a desert, but the GM may rule that it is so sunbaked and ancient that it will likely snap after a few uses.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Scent</th>
<td>Your sense of smell is almost feral or otherwise ultra-heightened. As a focus action, you can discern the number and relative location of living creatures within 60’. With an additional focus action you can lock onto a particular scent and maintain its relative location as long as it remains within 60’. Furthermore, you gain advantage 1 on attempts to track a creature if it has left a scent trail.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Scholar</th>
<td>You have spent years studying a particular discipline, such as physics, herbalism, dragon lore, history, politics, or religion. Once per session, you can re-roll a failed Learning check related to your discipline, gaining advantage 2 on the re-roll. Furthermore, you have colleagues and connections within your discipline, and know the proper channels for gaining access to specialty laboratories, libraries, temples, or other collections of lore related to your field of scholarship.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Silver Tongue</th>
<td>You have practiced the ways of sneaking hidden charms and subliminal messages within everyday conversation. Once per session, when you converse with an intelligent creature for at least five minutes, you will learn one useful secret of the GM’s choosing about the creature.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Stone Sense</th>
<td>While underground you may fail to find what you’re looking for, but you can never be truly lost. You can always find your way back to the entrance through which you entered. Furthermore, you have advantage 1 on any action rolls in which a familiarity with underground environments would prove helpful, such as attempts to identify the risk of a cave-in or to find a secret passage within a cavern.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Street Rat</th>
<td>You were raised on the streets or at least spent a good deal of time crawling about them. As such, you know how to navigate urban areas quickly, make yourself unseen, and find a bite to eat when you’re down on your luck. As one of the invisible urchins that crawl the city, you are also quite adept at picking up rumors in taverns and crowded streets. You gain advantage 1 on rolls for situations in which your street rat nature would be helpful.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Upper Class</th>
<td>Being of high birth, old money, or otherwise given access to resources beyond the common citizen, you are treated as a benefactor by the lower classes. They will trust and help you in the hopes of being rewarded for their efforts. You are also treated as a peer by those of similar or slightly higher social standing and can typically request an audience with them. In addition, representatives of the law generally assume you to be beyond reproach unless they are presented with compelling evidence to the contrary.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Vagabond</th>
<td>Having spent significant time fending for yourself in the wilderness, you excel at surviving and navigating in the wild. You always know the direction of true north and you can automatically find enough food to feed yourself plus a number of additional people equal to your Learning attribute score.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Warrior’s Code</th>
<td>As a veteran warrior, you command respect even from foes. Once per session, you can use this perk to cause an enemy or group of enemies to extend special concessions or favorable treatment toward you via an unspoken warrior’s code. The GM decides what these concessions look like. For example, your enemies might choose to trust you to come quietly and not shackle you, or overlook an insult that would have otherwise have been cause for bloodshed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Whisperer of the Wild</th>
<td>Once per game session, you can ask a single “yes” or “no” question of a plant or animal within earshot. The plant or animal automatically trusts you at least enough to answer the question truthfully. You receive the answer by way of an inner sense, and so this ability cannot be used for further two-way communication.</td>
