                <h2 class="introduction_headers">What is Open Legend?</h2>
                <p>Open Legend is a tabletop roleplaying game (or RPG) in which the players play the part of
                 mighty heroes and wicked villains in order to tell stories of epic proportion. In each game
                 of Open Legend, the intrepid characters will fight mythic beasts, break ancient curses,
                 unravel mysterious enigmas, discover treasures untold, and more. Open Legend is a streamlined
                 system designed to let you tell big stories using small rules. The rules get complex when they
                 need to, but never cumbersome, and wherever they could be cut out or simplified, they have been</p>
                 <p>With Open Legend, every ability you choose for your character is a new decision.
                 You're never required to choose from a short list, and every character has the potential
                 to access every ability. The story you choose to tell with these abilities and how they
                 manifest, is an opportunity to let your imagination run wild. Select the abilities that
                 match your vision and ignore the ones that don’t. The best part is it's fast and simple but still has lots of
                 potential for intricate and complex characters, if that's what you're looking for. Complex
                 and simple characters can both play a meaningful role in an Open Legend game.</p>

                <h2 class="introduction_headers">Banes and Boons for every character</h2>
                <p>Open Legend features a collection of banes and boons that any character can use as long as they
                possess the appropriate attributes. Banes allow you to stun your enemies, set them ablaze, or otherwise
                hinder them with devastating status effects. Boons are perks that you grant yourself or allies, such as
                magical healing, damage resistance, and flight. In Open Legend, no fighter is just a walking meat shield
                with a blade. He’s a trained combatant who can stun, blind, cripple, and hurl his foes across the battlefield.
                And when a sorceress summons an icy storm from the skies, she decides at the time of casting if she also wants
                it to slow, knockdown, or immobilize her enemies.</p>

                <h2 class="introduction_headers">Any genre, endless possibilities</h2>
                <p>The core rules are written to reflect a high fantasy, sword and sorcery setting, but Open Legend was purposefully
                designed to be open to any genre. The mechanics of the game focus on effects rather than flavor so that your gaming
                table can tell whatever kind of story it wants. Struggle for survival in a post-apocalyptic zombie wasteland. Soar
                amidst the clouds on your crystal-powered airship in a steampunk inspired campaign of swashbuckling sky pirates.
                Explore an alien-infested space station abandoned at the edge of the universe. The possibilities are endless.</p>
